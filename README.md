# **Spring Boot REST API Complete Project**

# Cloud Management Platform

## Overview

The Cloud Management Platform is a full-stack application designed to streamline the process of managing and selecting cloud services. The project leverages modern technologies like Spring Boot for the backend, and HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the frontend, providing a robust and user-friendly interface for both Cloud Vendors and Cloud Users.

## Key Features

1. **Entity Management:**
   - **Cloud Vendors:** Vendors can log in to the platform and provide detailed information about their cloud services, including Virtual Machine (VM) instances, storage options, network bandwidth, and security features. Each service offering includes precise pricing details, which are stored in a MySQL database for easy access and retrieval.
   - **Cloud Users:** Users can register and log in to search for cloud services that meet their needs. They can filter and select specific services from different vendors, calculate the total cost based on usage hours, and manage their cloud resources effectively.

2. **Dynamic Search and Selection:**
   - The platform offers a dynamic search feature that allows users to filter services based on various parameters, such as pricing, resource specifications, and vendor reputation. This ensures that users can find the most suitable cloud services for their needs quickly and efficiently.

3. **Interactive Pricing Calculator:**
   - A built-in pricing calculator allows users to estimate the total cost of their selected cloud services based on their projected usage. This feature provides transparency and helps users manage their budgets effectively.

4. **User Interface and Experience:**
   - The frontend of the application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a clean and intuitive user interface. Key enhancements include:
     - A logout button conveniently placed in the upper right corner for easy access.
     - A validation feature that ensures the accuracy of user inputs before submitting forms. The submit button is hidden until validation is complete, at which point a prompt for a new password is shown, followed by the reappearance of the submit button.

5. **Secure and Scalable Backend:**
   - The backend is powered by Spring Boot, ensuring a scalable and secure environment for managing user data, vendor services, and transactions. The platform is designed to handle a growing number of users and vendors efficiently.

6. **Database Management:**
   - The application uses MySQL to store all relevant data, including user profiles, vendor service offerings, and transaction histories. The database is structured to support complex queries and ensure quick data retrieval, contributing to the platformâ€™s overall performance.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Deployment:** Spring Boot application running on a local or cloud-based server

## Project Goals

The primary goal of the Cloud Management Platform is to simplify the process of finding and managing cloud resources for users, while providing cloud vendors with a streamlined way to offer and update their services. The platform aims to:
- Enhance user experience by providing a responsive and intuitive interface.
- Ensure transparency in pricing and service selection.
- Offer a secure environment for both vendors and users to conduct transactions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Automated Reporting:** Integration of automated reporting tools to generate usage and billing reports for users.
- **Advanced Security Features:** Implementation of two-factor authentication and encryption to enhance data security.
- **API Integration:** Development of APIs for third-party integrations, allowing vendors to sync their service offerings directly from their platforms.
