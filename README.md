# Introduction

This project is a complete guide to building a RESTful API using Spring Boot. It covers all essential aspects, from project setup and dependency management to deployment. The API performs CRUD operations on a simple entity (such as a User or Product), storing data in a relational database.

# Project Setup
Create a New Spring Boot Project:

Use Spring Initializr or your IDE to create a new Spring Boot project.
Add the necessary dependencies like Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database.
Project Structure:

Ensure your project follows a standard structure:

bash

Copy code

src/

├── main/

│   ├── java/

│   │   └── com/example/demo/

│   │       ├── controller/

│   │       ├── model/

│   │       ├── repository/

│   │       └── service/

│   └── resources/

│       ├── application.properties

└── test/

# Configuration:

Set up your application.properties or application.yml for database configuration and other settings.
Building the REST API
Create the Entity:

Define a model class that represents your database entity, e.g., User.
Repository Layer:

Create a repository interface for CRUD operations on the entity using Spring Data JPA.
Service Layer:

Implement a service layer to handle the business logic and interact with the repository.
Controller Layer:

Develop a controller class to expose REST endpoints (e.g., /users) for the entity.

# Data Persistence
Database Configuration:

Use H2 for an in-memory database during development or configure MySQL/PostgreSQL for production.
Repository Methods:

Utilize JpaRepository methods or custom queries to perform database operations.
